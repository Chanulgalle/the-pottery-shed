                <h2>About the Pottery Shed</h2>
                <p>
                    American pottery instructor Joe Darling came up with the idea for The Pottery Shed in 2010. 
                    To maximize achievement, the studio and classes are exquisitely set up. 
                    Please stop over and have a look at it for yourself; it's always open.<br><br>
                    We offer training levels to accommodate both absolute beginners and intermediates. For the brightest colors and the least energy impact, we fire to cone 03 instead. 
                    Midfire temperatures are another type of firing service.<br><br>
                    We provide a great three-class course for beginners as well as a special priced six-pack that includes three classes and three practice sessions. 
                    Each lesson lasts two hours and is structured similarly, with an introduction, a demonstration, and then a hands-on, step-by-step clay-making session.
                    The lesson's goal and guiding principles will be explained by the instructors. 
                    <span id="extra-content" class="hidden">
                    Make use of as much clay as necessary to comprehend the assignment. With a little focus and good fortune, you'll have mastered the fundamentals even if you attempt and fail a few times.
                    At the studio, all of the clay from unsuccessful attempts or those created purely for practice is recycled and put to new use.
